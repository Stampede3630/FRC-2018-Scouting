# FRC 2018 Scouting App

This is FRC team 3175 Knight Vision's scouting app for 2018 FIRST Power Up. The scouting app is aimed at helping teams observe the performance of other teams during the qualification matches.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. It is a Java applet, so it will be compatible with both Windows and Mac OS.

### Prerequisites

You will need [Java](https://java.com/en/) and Excel (2007 and later) for this applet.


### Installing

Follow the installation instructions of Java.
Unzip the folder of this project.

## Deployment

Open the Scouting.jar to record the data during matches.
The data are stored in data.xlsx as a short cut.

It takes six users to enter data for each match.
Enter the match number and the team number in the corresponding alliance station.
Click the start button to start and click on game elements when the robot scores (color does matter).
Select Teleop from the drop down box when it is time.
If something went wrong in a match, click reset to discard data for that match.
When the match is over, click submit to write the data to the excel file.
Compile and analyze the excel data sheets to find your pick for alliance selection.

## Contributing
